The MicroPasts project is founded on open principles - source, data and access.
All code for these projects is released on Github.

Our organisation can be found at:

https://github.com/micropasts

The SciFabric organisation hosts the source code for the Pybossa platform. We are slightly
behind their release cycle due to functions being removed that we consider key to our work.

* The defunct crowdfunding platform we built using Catarse
