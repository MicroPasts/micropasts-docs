# Welcome to MicroPasts' documentation

This documentation site will cover how to create, deploy, maintain and retrieve
data for citizen science projects based around Arts and Humanities subjects.

The MicroPasts citizen science platform is built on Scifabric's Pybossa software
and has been running since October 2013 (funded by the AHRC from 2013 - 2015.)
The framework we use (Pybossa), is described as:

> PYBOSSA is a technology developed by Scifabric. It is used for the development of platforms and data collection within collaborative environments, analysis and data enrichment.

>PYBOSSA is an extremely flexible and versatile technology with a multitude of applications that adapt to each specific case facilitating many of the daily tasks that take place in research environments such as museums, art galleries, heritage institutions, libraries of any kind, market research companies, hospitals, universities and all those organisations that manage data or require information from their customers/users -such as airports, shopping malls, banks, hotel chains, etc.

> PYBOSSAâ€™s simplicity consists in its easy adjustment to any areas using any of the available templates, this way every customer can then adapt it to their own needs.

> PYBOSSA can import data directly from other products such as Amazon S3, Twitter, Youtube, Google Spreadsheets, Flickr, Raspberry Pi, etc. Through all these integrations PYBOSSA allows data capture for further analysis made by users in a transparent and easy way.
