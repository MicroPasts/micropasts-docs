# Getting started

PYBOSSA is a python web server built using the Flask
micro-framework. You will need the following **officially supported requirements**:

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python >= 3.6
- PostgreSQL >= 9.5
- Redis >= 2.6
- pip >= 6.1

In general, all those dependencies are available within the Ubuntu distribution,
so you should be able to install all of them without problems.
