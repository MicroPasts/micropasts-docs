The Bronze Age Index transcription project was the MicroPasts flagship project
that was originally the foundation for our grant being funded. This project enabled the
transcription of 30,000 index cards, which recorded the discovery of Bronze Age
metalwork (mainly from the UK) and was stored at the British Museum's Orsman Road facility.

These cards were scanned by Dr Jennifer Wexler over the course of a year and the
project was quite simple.

You have two quick methods available to you for adding this project to the system.

1. Through the point and click interface system
2. Through the creation of code and pushing to the system via PBS
