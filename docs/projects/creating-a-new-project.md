!!! question "How do I open this page?"

    You must be registered to access these pages.

To create a new project, you have three options:

1. Create a new project from scratch using Github and PBS
2. Create a new project from a template
3. Create directly from the interface

Below, we will run through each method:

## Create a new project from scratch using Github and PBS<a name="method1"></a>

This is very well documented by the original [PYBOSSA documentation]()/build/pbs/)
Example projects that have been generated using this method can be found on our Github profile.

* [Horsfield archive tagging](https://github.com/MicroPasts/MicroPasts-Horsfield)
* [Middle East Postcards, British Museum](https://github.com/MicroPasts/middleEastPostcards)

Each of these repos has the code structure ready to deploy. If you want to use this method,
try to replicate this structure, or create a repo from the template found at:

https://github.com/MicroPasts/MicroPasts-PBS-template

## Create a new project from a template

Currently within the MicroPasts framework, we have the following template projects,
which you could use for the basis of creating your own code. Each of these can be
accessed by click and deploy methods from the PYBOSSA interfaces.

!!! question "So how do I use these?"
    To use these you will need to:<br/>
      1. Either register or login to your account<br/>
      2. Go to https://crowdsourced.micropasts.org/project/new<br/>
      3. Follow the steps below!

!!! question "I would like another template to be added, is this possible?"
    Yes, once you have a template either from [method 1](#method1) or [method 2](#method2), let the project
    team know and we'll add it, or if you're okay with github, create a pull request
    based on the tutorial for adding a snippet.

## Create directly from the interface <a name="#method2"></>
