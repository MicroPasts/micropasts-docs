To create a new project, you have three options:

1. Create a new project from scratch using Github and PBS
2. Create a new project from a template
3. Create directly from the interface

Below, we will run through each method:

## Create a new project from scratch using Github and PBS<a name="method1"></a>

## Create a new project from a template

Currently within the MicroPasts framework, we have the following template projects:

1. Bronze Age card index transcription (with geocoding)
2. Archaeological record index transcription from the Montpelier Foundation, USA
3. Photomasking to enable 3d models to be made in Agisoft Metashape
4. Phototagging using the Annotorious framework
5. Audio transcription from mp3 recordings
6. Bronze Age axe outlines for morphological analysis
7. PDF manipulation
8. A basic template for customisation
9. transcription of Egyptian Exploration Society donor registers
10. A basic sound recognition template
11. A IIIF manifest based transcription task from Cambridge Digital Library

!!! question "So how do I use these?"
    To use these you will need to:
      1. Either register or login to your account
      2. Go to https://crowdsourced.micropasts.org/project/new
      3. Follow the steps below!

!!! question "I would like another template to be added, is this possible?"
    Yes, once you have a template either from [method 1](#method1) or [method 2](#method2), let the project
    team know and we'll add it, or if you're okay with github, create a pull request
    based on the tutorial for adding a snippet.

## Create directly from the interface <a name="#method2"></>
