As part of our AHRC funded work, we wanted to create 3D models and speed up the creation
of photomasks for use in their production. Harnessing the power of the crowd allowed us to
scale up and teach new skills to participants.

!!! question "How do I open this page?"

    You must be registered to access the creation page

## Create a masking project

You have two quick methods available to you for adding this project to the system.

1. Through the point and click interface system
2. Through the creation of code and pushing to the system via PBS

### Interface deployment

### PBS deployment

### Importing tasks

### What will this produce?

After manipulation of these results via R ([using this code](https://github.com/MicroPasts/MicroPasts-Scripts/tree/master/photoMasking)) image masks are generated for use within Photogrammetric software.
We used Agisoft's Photoscan (now Metashape) to produce 3d models (over 100 were produced) and an example is displayed below.
